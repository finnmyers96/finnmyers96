## About Me

I'm a machine learning engineer and PhD student at the University of Vermont, where I develop predictive models for environmental systems using tools like **graph neural networks**, **computer vision**, and **spatiotemporal deep learning**. Iâ€™m especially interested in how AI can improve understanding and management of natural resources, from **river turbidity forecasting** to **agricultural water and nutrient management** to **floodplain oxygen modeling**.

My work combines:
- **Advanced machine learning** (GNNs, LSTMs, CNNs, ViTs)  
- **Geospatial analytics & remote sensing** (Planet imagery, GEE, rasterio)  
- **Data pipeline engineering** (custom ETL workflows, SLURM, shell scripting)
